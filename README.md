Echoes - iOS
================

Echoes is an iOS application that allows you to send messages or images based on locations.  

Your messages will be received by those who enter the location(s) that you sent from! 

You are able to see which locations have messages saved, however, you can only unlock the messages if you enter that location(s).

Applications
--------

- This app can behave like a scavenger hunt game, where you submit clues in a certain location, others can only access the clues if they enter the range of the location

- When a group of friends trying to meet up in a building, one friend can send a message or image of his/her location, others can receive the message once they enter the building and find each other easily
